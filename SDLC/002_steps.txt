-> After creating an application, we also need to tell Django that it should use it. 

-> We do that in the file mysite/settings.py.

-> open it in your code editor. We need to find INSTALLED_APPS and add a line containing 'blog', just above ]. 

-> So the final product should look like this:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'blog',
]
